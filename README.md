GTA Batch Handling Editor

I used to play GTA IV, and I liked modding specially the handling file to my tastes, however, I wanted to mod all the values of all vehicles (or some, e.g: bikes) at once, for example, multiplying the value of the engine power or top speed by some number, I couldn't find anything on the web that did that and that worked for both IV and EFLC, then I decided to make my own.

This program should work with any GTA version (HD era) with only minor adjustments, so I'm waiting for the GTA V handling to be moddable in order to put it to the test.

It's written in Python (2) and requires PyQt4 to work, in the future I'm going to build binaries with pyinstaller.

With this program you can easily select (and de-select) a vehicle category (sports cars, bikes, etc.) and add, multiply or set all the values of a variable.
